# Bird-Strikes---Data-Visualization
A bird strike is strictly defined as a collision between a bird and an aircraft which is in
flight or on a take-off or landing roll. The term is often expanded to cover other wildlife
strikes - with bats or ground animals. Bird Strike is common and can be a significant
threat to aircraft safety. For smaller aircraft, significant damage may be caused to the
aircraft structure and all aircraft, especially jet-engine ones, are vulnerable to the loss of
thrust which can follow the ingestion of birds into engine air intakes. This has resulted in
several fatal accidents. Bird strikes may occur during any phase of flight, but are most
likely during the take-off, initial climb, approach and landing phases due to the greater
numbers of birds in flight at lower levels. To have a closer look the following document
visually depicts the data collected on Bird Strikes by FAA between 2000-2011.
